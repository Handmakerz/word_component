_**Testing word bank component.**_

Experimenting with different concepts, while taking notes. Breaking, testing, and trying different ideas. This project contains a basic simple loop, with a setInterval function that displays different web development and CS terms according to the time setInterval. The objective is simplifying and starting with one feature at a time. Then connect each piece like a puzzle.  Testing project still in progress....|;-}
