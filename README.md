_**Testing word bank component.**_

Experimenting with different concepts, while taking notes. Breaking, testing, and trying different ideas. This is a very basic simple loop that displays different web development in addition to CS terms. The objective is simplifying and starting with one feature at a time. Then connect each piece like a puzzle. NOTE:Timer isn't correct still working on it, with other concepts...  Testing project still in progress....|;-}
